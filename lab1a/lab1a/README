1. lab1a.c:
This is the source file for lab1a. After compiling it, it performs Character-at-a-time, non-canonical input mode with no echo. 
Running without options, it will read the input from keyboard, and write it to the stdout through pipeline.
With --shell option, it will fork a new process and excute a shell line. Sequentially, it will read input from keyboard, echo it to output, write it to shell, read the output of shell, and echo it to the ouput.

2. Makefile:
It has the following three functionalities:
default: compile the lab1a.c to excutable lab1a with -Wall and -Wextra options.
dist: make a tarball containing all the required files including lab1a.c, README, and Makefile.
clean: remove all the files created by the makefile, and return the dictionary to the original state as just after untared.

3. README
README is the current file which describes all the files and corresponding contents in the tarball.

Testing Methodology:
Use 'make' to compile the program, and './lab1a' to run the program. Try typing texts on the keyboard, see the corresponding outputs shows character-at-a-time. Try type 'ctrl-c' and 'ctrl-d' and 'ctrl-l' to see corresponding features.
Use './lab1a --shell' to run the program with shell mode. Try typing some shell command like 'ls' or 'du', and see the corresponding output of shell on the screen.
